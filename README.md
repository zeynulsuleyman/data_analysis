Analyzing Police Activity with Pandas:     This project explores the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyzes the impact of weather, time of day, reason for traffic stop and gender of driver on police behavior. It covers cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data.
